# Time-Series-Forecasting
Air Quality Forecasting
This is your first graded assignment for the Machine Learning Techniques I course. It focuses on applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to solve a real-world problem: forecasting air pollution levels. Air pollution, particularly PM2.5, is a critical global issue that impacts public health and urban planning. By accurately predicting PM2.5 concentrations, governments and communities can take timely action to mitigate their effects.

This project uses historical air quality and weather data to predict PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. You will:

Preprocess sequential data to uncover patterns.
Design and train RNN or LSTM models to make accurate predictions.
Fine-tune the model and run several experiments. The goal is to have a Root Mean Squared Error below 4000 on the Leaderboard.
